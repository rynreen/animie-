         <h4>Toradora</h4></td>
       <td>  <p class="abc">For romance lovers, Toradora is a brilliant slice-of-life anime with well-written and fully-fleshed out characters.
         The series focuses on Ryuji and Taiga, who seem to have diametrically-opposite personalities. While they both agree to help each other with their crushes, their attempts backfire and they are placed in awkward romantic situations.</p></td></tr></table>

        <h4>5 Centimeters Per Second</h4></td>
        <td> <p class="abc">Makoto Shinkai’s films have been expressly praised for the picture-perfect visuals so well-composed and artistically rendered that almost every frame can be a wallpaper. Moreover, the director is known for his careful attention-to-detail, 
              focusing on the small meaningful moments of life that we often barely notice. </p></td></tr></table>

          <h4> Aria The Animati</h4></td>
        <td>  <p class="abc"> If you’re looking for something more futuristic but with an old-world charm, then Aria might be the anime you’re looking for. It is set in the 24th century on the planet Mars (now called Aqua) in a place called Neo-Venezia (sounds familiar, right?)
            And no, there isn’t any epic space war going on. Instead, we follow the adventures of Akari Mizunashi, a teenager who is training to be a tour guide in the city’s gondola service. A slow-paced show filled with gorgeous visuals and a sense of optimism, Aria makes for a memorable watch.</p></td></tr></table>

          <h4> Violet Evergarden </h4></td>

           <h4> Whisper Of The Heart (1995)</h4></td>
          <td> <p class="abc">If you’re looking for a feel-good romance film, then this Studio Ghibli movie is a perfect treat, focusing on the love story between bookworm Shizuku and Seiji, a violin-maker, who also attends the same school. Filled with heartwarming and funny moments, there’s also a story-within-a-story in this film as Shizuku 
        who dreams of being a writer one day, writes a fantasy story featuring herself, a cat statuette called the “Baron” and a cat she followed on the train. While the love story is nicely resolved at the end of the film, the cat-story gets a sequel of sorts in the spin-off The Cat Returns (2002).   </p></td></tr></table>

The dad will only agree if she can convince Kokonotsu to take over his shop. Given that dagashi shops are pretty rare,
               this heart-warming highlights a part of Japanese culture that you may have otherwise, missed.        </p></td></tr></table>
